## How to use this thing
Just click on the 2KDraftEvents.exe file.

## How to change the players names that show up in the output?
Modify the players.csv file

You can do this in excel, there needs to be two columns

DraftPostiion | Name
---------------------
1             | Mike Dunleavy
----------------------
2             | Brandon Jennings
----------------------
3             | Lebron James
-----------------------

... and so on, there needs to be 60 players, so 61 rows including the header.

## Where's the logic that runs this?

You can see the draft event logic in the draftEvents.json file.
You can modify it to add new draft events or change probabilities.
Just follow the pattern thats in there already.
